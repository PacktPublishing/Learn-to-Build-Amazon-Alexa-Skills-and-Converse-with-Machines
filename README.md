## About the Video Course
There is a shift happening in the way we as a species communicate with machines. With the advent of Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Siri, and Microsoft Cortana, the focus on voice user interfaces or voice-activated conversational interfaces is rapidly increasing. This ever-changing world presents a threat to the way we operate, especially when we do not understand it. A more AI aware world might be years away, but if we learn how to talk to and control the machines then we grow collectively. The real goal for this course is to make you competent enough to understand the complexities that go behind designing and creating the voice user interfaces, so that you can immediately assess how different pieces of the puzzle fit together. Yes, Amazon Alexa and similar voice activated interfaces look and sound pretty cool, but it is also possible through the extensive documentation that is available to build systems for these interfaces. However, just learning the syntax of a particular system is not enough. To mature as an individual, you need to gain the foundational skills on how these interfaces operate, and be technology agnostic when it comes to building these conversational interfaces.
